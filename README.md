This project explores a healthcare stroke dataset using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to understand patterns related to factors like BMI, smoking habits, glucose levels, and lifestyle attributes. The code cleans the data by handling missing BMI values, examines categorical features such as smoking status and work type, and applies conditional filtering to highlight specific groups like smokers and individuals with lower BMI. It also visualizes key health indicators through bar plots and histograms to reveal trends in smoking behavior and glucose levels. Overall, this analysis helps uncover meaningful insights that could support stroke-related research and data-driven decision-making.
